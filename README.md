The purpose of the [OpenMRS Cohort Module](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/Cohort+Module) is to manage Cohort related Data, Types, Attributes, Attribute Types and Members while using REST to allow external system integration. Cohort management can be performed one of two ways:

 1. Simple cohorts for single entities
 2. Group cohorts catering to collections like households.
