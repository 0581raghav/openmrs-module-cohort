The purpose of the [OpenMRS Cohort Module](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/Cohort+Module) is to manage cohort-related data, types, attributes, attribute types and members, while using REST to allow external system integration. Cohort management can be performed one of two ways:
1. Simple cohorts for single entities; or
2. Group cohorts catering to collections like households.
