The purpose of the [OpenMRS Cohort Module](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/Cohort+Module) is to manage Cohort related Data, Types, Attributes, Attribute Types and Members while using REST to allow external system integration. Cohort Management can be performed in two ways:
1. Simple Cohorts for single entities.
2. Group cohorts catering to collections like households.
